        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li>
            <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Directions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
